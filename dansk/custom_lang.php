/**
 * This file is here for overriding (or extending) Pancake's language files,
 * in an update-safe manner.
 *
 * If you need to edit anything in a Pancake language file, you can override it here.
 * And if you need to add anything to a Pancake language file, you can add it here.
 *
 * This file will likely never be updated by us, so Pancake won't ask you to overwrite it when updating.
 * (If it does, then that means we did update it, and you should back it up before updating, like it tells you to.)
 *
 * How to override language strings:
 *
 * $lang['global:search'] = 'CUSTOM SEARCH';
 *
 * How to add new language strings (useful if you're customizing the theme):
 *
 * $lang['custom:label'] = 'Custom Title';
 *

$lang['custom:label'] = 'Custom Title';
